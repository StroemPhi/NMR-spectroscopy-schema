Classes Assay - A planned process with the objective to produce information about the material entity that is the evaluant, by physically examining it or its proxies. NMRspectroscopy - An assay that exploits the magnetic properties of certain nuclei (those with a spin) to resonate when placed in particular magnetic field conditions. Instruments recording NMR spectrum and sets of analysis can be used to deduce identity of chemical as well as composition of complex chemical mixtures. PulsedNMRspectroscopy - Spectroscopy where the energy states of spin-active nuclei placed in a static magnetic field are interrogated by inducing transitions between the states via radio frequency irradiation.
